CHUBBY CAT!
sushiREPL.rb is made for a class assignment to create a "make your own adventure game" to practice Ruby syntax, flow, variables, and methods.
sushigame.rb is my creative additional step to learn new skills - it is an interactive game with a point counter on the top right, and time left counter on the top left. Do your best to feed Chubby Cat.

Thanks for visiting!
